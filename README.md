# OpenSource Projects @ Scaler 
Scaler Academy Open Source Projects Hub 

## About 

The **Scaler Open Source Projects Hub** is a place for the Scaler community, alumni of Scaler Academy and members of the InterviewBit tech team to come together and collaborate and big and small open source projects. 
Many people within InterviewBit and Scaler communities are long time contributors of the vibrant open source software ecosystem, and we feel a community built around computer science and software engineering should have a space to collaborate together and idea both useful and fun. 
The OS Projects Hub is open for anyone and everyone to come and be a part of and collaborate together on. Read on further in this page to know more about the projects and how to participate. 


## Participate 

There are a bunch of things you can do participate 

- Join [our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/scaler) and chat with the community on the `#talk-open-source` channel 
- Go over to [the discussion forum](https://github.com/scaleracademy/open-source-projects/discussions) to discuss new ideas and help plan projects 


### Discussions

Most of the communication regarding ideas and projects will take place on the [discussion space](https://github.com/scaleracademy/open-source-projects/discussions) of this Github Repo. There are bunch of subforums, the purpose of which are described below. 

#### [📣 Announcements](https://github.com/scaleracademy/open-source-projects/discussions/categories/announcements) 
As apparent from the name, when admmins and maintainers of the OSP have any new announcements, those will be available here. 

#### [💬 General](https://github.com/scaleracademy/open-source-projects/discussions/categories/general)
A general forum to talk about anything, if you want to share a new idea, or discuss the progress of a particular project, use the _Projects_ or _Ideas_ subforums below

#### [💡 Ideas](https://github.com/scaleracademy/open-source-projects/discussions/categories/ideas)
Have a new idea which we can build here ? (It doesn't matter if you yourself want to maintain/contribute to it, or you are simply suggesting to the community to build it) Come over here and create a new thread detailing your idea, and then all of us shal discuss about it. 
If it generates enough interest and we are able to come to a well-formed specification around what the initial version of it will look like, we will take it up as a project and induct it into the OSP hub. 

#### [📦 Projects](https://github.com/scaleracademy/open-source-projects/discussions/categories/projects) 
Once we pick up a new project, one thread per project will be made in this forum. All discussions around progress updates, future features planned and roadmaps for that project will be discussed here. 

#### [❓ Q&A](https://github.com/scaleracademy/open-source-projects/discussions/categories/q-a)
Any questions regarding contributions, participation, or anything about this initiative - feel free to ask them here.
